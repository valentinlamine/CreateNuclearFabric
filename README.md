# About 
Create nuclear is a mod that adds a whole nuclear system to the create mod. An optimized reactor produces over a million SU.

Create nuclear also adds Uranium ores and all the refining process to create and power the reactor automatically even from infinite sources like cobblestone with a complex refining process that exploits all the potential of create appliances.
